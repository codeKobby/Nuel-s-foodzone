## 2. Backoffice POS System (`/backoffice`)

This is the comprehensive, internal tool for cafe staff, accessible via the `/backoffice` route. It provides a robust solution for managing menu items, processing orders with complex payment scenarios, tracking stock, managing customer rewards, and analyzing sales data with powerful, AI-driven insights.

### Core Backoffice Features

- **Dual-Role Interface**: Separate, tailored views for `Manager` and `Cashier` roles to ensure staff have access to the tools they need.
