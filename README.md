This is a comprehensive, Next.js-based Point of Sale (POS) application designed for Nuel's Food Zone. It provides a robust solution for managing menu items, processing orders with complex payment scenarios, tracking stock, managing customer rewards, and analyzing sales data with powerful, AI-driven insights.

## Core Features
